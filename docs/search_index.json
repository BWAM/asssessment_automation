Smith 2020-04-02 1 Introduction The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (NYSDEC’s) Bureau of Water Assessment and Management (BWAM) has made it a top priority to automate waterbody assessments as dictated by NYSDEC’s Consolidated Assessment and Listing Methodology (CALM). For this process to work efficiently, BWAM will need to 1) establish authoritative data repositories and 2) establish a standardized process for applying the assessment process outlined in the CALM.

["calm.html", "2 CALM 2.1 Overview 2.2 Data Modernization", " 2 CALM 2.1 Overview The NYSDEC maintains a CALM that describes the processes and procedures used to assess the quality of New York’s surface waters and determine the attainment status in each waterbody consistent with applicable water quality standards and guidance values. The following dichotomous key and Figure 2.1 provide two ways of simplifying the assessment process outlined in the CALM. The assessments are used by New York state for management purposes and ultimately reported to the United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in the form of a 303d list. Dichotomous Key 1a.) The following requirements are NOT met: ELAP certified lab used for analytics (Not applicable until we consider external data sources) Project has an approved QAPP (Not applicable until we consider external data sources) &lt; 10 years old (assessment_period(); within_assess_period == FALSE) Requires manual review 1b.) The above requirements are met (assessment_period(); within_assess_period == TRUE) [2] 2a.) Does not meet the required minimum number of samples or minimum number of years for assessment. (assessment_min_req(); min_req_met == FALSE) [3] 2b.) Meets the required minimum number of samples and minimum number of years for assessment. (assessment_min_req(); min_req_met == TRUE) [5] 3a.) There is a Water Quality Standard violation Classify as Impaired/Unconfirmed IR3 3b.) There is no Water Quality Standard violation [4] 4a.) &gt;= 75% IQR of Water Quality Standard Classify as Stressed/Unconfirmed IR3 4b.) &lt; 75% IWR of Water Quality Standard Classify as Fully Supported/Unconfirmed IR3 5a.)

The parameter is considered a pollutant Classify as Impaired/Confirmed IR4c 10b.) The parameter is not considered a pollutant Classify as Impaired/Confirmed IR5 Figure 2.1: A decision tree to vizualize the assessment process as defined in the NYSDEC CALM. 2.2 Data Modernization BWAM is piloting the Division of Water’s (DOW’s) Data Modernization effort in partnership with the New York State Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) which will create a robust data workflow for all BWAM related data (Figure 2.2). Progress of the Data Modernization and Automation of Assessment projects are not dependent upon one another, but these projects are not mutually exclusive. The process developed for the Automation of Assessment will ultimately be inserted in the data workflow produced by the Data Modernization project (Figure 2.2). Furthermore, the Data Modernization effort will ultimately produce the authoritative data repositories, in the form of Oracle databases, necessary for automating assessments. No definitive deadline has been establish for the completion of the authoritative Oracle databases; however, the Data Modernization development process has forced the Stream Monitoring and Assessment Section (SMAS), the Lake Monitoring and Assessment Section (LMAS), and the Water Assessment and Implementation Section (WAIS) to begin to compile, re-structure, and re-format their data sets into interim-databases in preparation for the creation of these authoritative Oracle databases. These interim-databases will serve as the current authoritative databases with the expectation that there will be changes to the structure and format of the data once the Oracle databases are finalized, but these changes will be relatively minor. Attempting to align these two efforts as much as possible should ultimately be cost effective, because these two efforts have the potential to be mutually beneficial. Figure 2.2: An overview of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (NYSDEC’s) Bureau of Water Assessment and Management (BWAM) data workflow. The portion of the process surrounded by the red dotted box is most relavent to the automation of assessments. Within the red box are two authoratative database (i.e., the authoratative stream and lake databases) for storing observed water quality variables. Relavent observed values are quired out of these authoratitative databases and processed with an R-script applying CALM logic to assess waterbodies. The assessments produced by the R-script are stored within the authoratative Assessment database, which can be subsequently queried for reporting purposes. "],
["water-quality-standards.html", "3 Water Quality Standards 3.1 Waterbody Class Hierarchy 3.2 Designated Uses", " 3 Water Quality Standards 3.1 Waterbody Class Hierarchy Fresh and saline surface water classes generally conform to a descending alphabetical hierarchy (Figure 3.1). Class D represents the most upstream class of the fresh surface waters, while class AA-Special represents the most downstream class. Similarly, class SD represents the most upstream class of the saline surface waters, while class SA represents the most downstream class. The saline surface water class I’s are only associated with secondary contact recreation and fishing, and therefore are treated independently of the other saline surface water classes– the relationship between waterbody classes and designated uses is discussed further in the Designated Uses section. Figure 3.1: The general waterbody class hierarchy for which New York State Deparment of Environmental Conservation. Water quality standards are inherited in descending alphabetical order. WQS assigned to upstream classes are inherited by all downstream classes. The most upstream class associated with a WQS will be refered to as the “root” class for a given standard. For example, WQS with a root of D and SD classes will be applicable to all downstream fresh surface water classes (i.e., C, B, A, A-Special, AA, AA-Special, and their associated Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) variants) and saline surface water classes (i.e., SC, SB, and SA), respectively. In many instances, the WQSs become increasingly more restrictive moving downstream through the hierarchy. D and SD represent the most upstream classes in fresh and saline surface waters, respectively, and therefore influence all other classes. However, D and SD classes do not always represent the root class for a given WQS. Although most WQS are inherited according to this logic, there are multiple descrepencies. 3.1.1 Descrepencies The following WQS do not follow the logic depicted in Figure 3.1. 3.1.1.1 Aquatic (Acute) Aquatic (Acute) designates at type of WQS. The class hierarchy associated with Aquatic (Acute) WQSs are treated inconsistently by NYSDEC. In some instances the class hierarchy follows the rules depicted in Figure 3.1, but there are multiple instances where Aquatic (Acute) WQSs are only applicable to fresh and saline surface water classes D and SD, respectively (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2: Many water quality standards of type, Aquatic (Acute), are only applicable for fresh and saline surface waters D and SD, respectively. Therefore, Aquatic (Acute) standards are not always inherited by the classes downstream of D and SD in their respective hierarchies. There is no standaridized logic dictating when Aquatic (Acute) water quality standards are or are not inherited by their descendants. 3.1.1.2 Trout and Trout Spawning Waters Fresh surface water classes C, B, A, A-Special, AA, and AA-Special have variants designating Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) waterbodies (e.g., C(T) and C(TS)). For the majority of parameters, these variants have the same WQS as the non-T/TS waterbody classes (Figure 3.1). Dissolved oxygen and ammonia as NH3 WQS differ between non-T/TS, T, and TS waterbody class variants (Figure 3.3); non-T/TS variants have the least stringent standards, while TS variants have the most stringent standards. Figure 3.3: New York State’s fresh surface water dissolved oxygen and ammonia as NH3 water quality standards for class C, B, A, A-Special, AA, and AA-Special differ amoung Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) class variants. 3.1.1.3 Dissolved Solids The WQS for dissolved solids in fresh surface waters is defined as “Shall be kept as low as practicable to maintain the best usage of waters but in no case shall it exceed 500 mg/L.” for classes C, B, A, AA, and AA-Special (Figure 3.4). The standard for class A-Special is “Shall not exceed 200 mg/L.” This deviates from the general logic depicted in Figure 3.1 becuase the A-Special class is more stringent than it’s downstream classes, AA and AA-Special. Figure 3.4: New York State’s fresh surface water dissolved solids water quality standards are more stringent for class A-Special than the other waterbody classes. This deviates from the general logic that the downstream classes (i.e., AA and AA-Special) will inherit the standards of class A-Special. 3.1.1.4 Total and Fecal Coliforms The WQSs for total and fecal coliforms in fresh surface waters follow the logic dictated in Figure 3.1, except there is no total coliform standard appicable to class AA-Special (Figure 3.5) and there are no fecal coliform standards appicable to class AA or AA-Special (Figure 3.6). Figure 3.5: There is no total coliform standard defined for fresh water surface class AA-Special in New York State. Figure 3.6: There are no fecal coliform standards defined for fresh water surface classes AA or AA-Special in New York State. 3.2 Designated Uses "]
