<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Water Quality Standards</h1>
<p>NYS’s water quality standards (WQS) are defined in <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&amp;originationContext=documenttoc&amp;transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)">Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703</a>.</p>
<div id="waterbody-class-hierarchy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Waterbody Class Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Fresh and saline surface water classes generally conform to a descending alphabetical hierarchy (Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-general">3.1</a>). Class D represents the most upstream class of the fresh surface waters, while class AA-Special represents the most downstream class. Similarly, class SD represents the most upstream class of the saline surface waters, while class SA represents the most downstream class. The saline surface water class I is only associated with secondary contact recreation and fishing, and therefore are treated independently of the other saline surface water classes– the relationship between waterbody classes and designated uses is discussed further in the <a href="water-quality-standards.html#designated-uses">Designated Uses</a> section.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>WQS assigned to upstream classes are inherited by all downstream classes. The most upstream class associated with a WQS will be refered to as the “root” class for a given standard. For example, WQS with a root of D and SD classes will be applicable to all downstream fresh surface water classes (i.e., C, B, A, A-Special, AA, AA-Special, and their associated Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) variants) and saline surface water classes (i.e., SC, SB, and SA), respectively. In many instances, the WQSs become increasingly more restrictive moving downstream through the hierarchy. D and SD represent the most upstream classes in fresh and saline surface waters, respectively, and therefore influence all other classes. However, D and SD classes do not always represent the root class for a given WQS. Although most WQS are inherited according to this logic, there are multiple descrepencies.</p>

<div id="aquatic-acute" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1.1</span> Aquatic (Acute)</h4>
Aquatic (Acute) designates a type of WQS. The class hierarchy associated with Aquatic (Acute) WQSs are treated inconsistently by NYSDEC. In some instances the class hierarchy follows the rules depicted in Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-general">3.1</a>, but there are multiple instances where Aquatic (Acute) WQSs are only applicable to fresh and saline surface water classes D and SD, respectively (Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-aa">3.2</a>).

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1.2</span> Trout and Trout Spawning Waters</h4>
<p>Fresh surface water classes C, B, A, A-Special, AA, and AA-Special have variants designating Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) waterbodies (e.g., C(T) and C(TS)). For the majority of parameters, these variants have the same WQS as the non-T/TS waterbody classes (Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-general">3.1</a>). Dissolved oxygen and ammonia as NH<sub>3</sub> WQS differ between non-T/TS, T, and TS waterbody class variants (Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-do-ammonia">3.3</a>); non-T/TS variants have the least stringent standards, while TS variants have the most stringent standards.</p>

<div id="dissolved-solids" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1.3</span> Dissolved Solids</h4>
<p>The WQS for dissolved solids in fresh surface waters is defined as “Shall be kept as low as practicable to maintain the best usage of waters but in no case shall it exceed 500 mg/L” for classes C, B, A, AA, and AA-Special (Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-dissolved-solids">3.4</a>). The standard for class A-Special is “Shall not exceed 200 mg/L.” This deviates from the general logic depicted in Figure <a href="water-quality-standards.html#fig:wqs-general">3.1</a> becuase the A-Special class is more stringent than it’s downstream classes, AA and AA-Special.</p>
