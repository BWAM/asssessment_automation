# Water Quality Standards and Guidance Values

NYS's water quality standards (WQSs) and guidance values (GVs) are defined in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)), and [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf), respectively. WQSs and GVs are assigned to fresh and saline surface water classes, and ultimately determine if a waterbody is attaining its designated uses (i.e., fishing, secondary contact recreation, primary contact recreation, source water supply, and shellfishing). In general, the relationship between waterbody classes is hierarchical.

## Waterbody Class Hierarchy

Fresh and saline surface water classes generally conform to a descending alphabetical hierarchy (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general)). Class D represents the most upstream class of the fresh surface waters, while the various A-classes represent the most downstream classes (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general)A). The A-class represent different types of waterbodies associated with drinking water (see [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 701](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I06849fe0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default))). Similar to the fresh surface water classes, class SD represents the most upstream class of the saline surface waters, while class SA represents the most downstream class (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general)B). Class I, within saline surface waters, is downstream of class SC and upstream of class SB; therefore, class I creates a discrepancy in the descending alphabetical hierarchy of saline surface water classes. 

```{r wqs-general, fig.align='center', out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The standard waterbody class hierarchy of fresh (A) and saline surface waters (B) for which New York State's water quality standards are in general inherited in descending alphabetical order. The white-boxes represent the waterbody classes and the arrows indicate the direction that water quality standards are inherited through the class hierarchy. * Fresh surface water classes that have non-trout, trout (T), and trout spawning (TS) variants."}

                        dpi = 300)
```

WQSs and GVs assigned to upstream classes are inherited by all downstream classes. The most upstream class associated with a WQS or GV will be referred to as the "root" class for a given standard. For example, fishing use WQSs and GVs have a root of D and SD classes, and therefore will be applicable to all downstream fresh surface water classes (i.e., C, B, A-classes, and their associated Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) variants) and saline surface water classes (i.e., I, SC, SB, and SA), respectively. D and SD represent the most upstream classes in fresh and saline surface waters, respectively, and therefore influence all other classes. However, D and SD classes do not always represent the root class for a given WQS or GV. The root class for source water supply WQSs and GVs is A-classes, and therefore the standard is only applicable to A, A-Speical, AA, and AA-Special (see [Designated Best Uses and Standard Types). Inheritance through the hierarchy does not necessarily imply that all class have the same WQSs or GVs; in many instances, the WQSs or GVs become increasingly more restrictive moving downstream through the hierarchy. WQSs and GVs do not become less restrictive moving downstream through the hierarchy. This hierarchy provides a logical relationship between waterbody classes, but the hierarchy must be considered within the context of a waterbodies designated best use(s) for assessment purposes.


### Designated Best Uses and Standard Types

Waterbodies in NYS are assigned designated best use(s) (i.e., Fishing, Secondary Contact Recreation, Primary Contact Recreation, Source Water Supply, and Shellfishing) determined by the waterbody class. Fishing, Primary Contact Recreation, and Secoundary Contact Recreation uses are applicable to fresh and saline surface waters, while the Source Water Supply and Shellfishing uses are only applicable to fresh and saline surface waters, respectively. Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general-use) overlays the class hierarchy depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general) on the designated best uses the classes support. For example, all fresh surface water class support the Fishing use, while only A-classes support the Source Water Supply use (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general-use)A). Furthermore, A-classes support all fresh surface water uses (i.e., Fishing, Secondary Contact Recreation, Primary Contact Recreation, Source Water Supply), while class D only supports the fresh surface water Fishing use. [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) and [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf) do not directly identify which designated best use(s) is supported by a given WQS or GV.

```{r wqs-general-use, fig.align='center', out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The designated waterbody uses and associated waterbody types of fresh (A) and saline surface waters (B) in New York State overlain with the water quality standards waterbody class hierarchy.The white-boxes represent the waterbody classes and the arrows indicate the direction that water quality standards are inherited through the class hierarchy. * Fresh surface water classes that have non-trout, trout (T), and trout spawning (TS) variants."}

[Title 6 NYCRR, Part 702](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I06b83300b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) defines eight WQS/GV-types that provide an link between a WQS or GV and the best use the standard supports (Table \@ref(tab:use-type-table), Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general-use)). Types are subsets of best uses, which identify the specific aspect of a use that is assessed by a given WQS or GV. In practice, the types specified in the WQS or GV tables in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) and [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf) must be utilized to cross-walked the WQSs and GVs in these tables to the best use(s) supported. For example, in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.5](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) the WQSs for mercury differ between five types: 1) Health (Water Source), 2) Health (Fish Consumption), 3) Aquatic (Chronic), 4) Aquatic (Acute), and 5) Wildlife. Therefore, there are four standards for assessing the fishing use (i.e., Health (Fish Consumption), Aquatic (Chronic), Aquatic (Acute), and Wildlife types) and a single standard for assessing the source water supply use (i.e., Health (Water Source) type). The

Many of the WQSs defined outside of [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.5](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) do not have defined WQS/GV-types, and therefore support all designated best uses associated with a given class. For example, the dissolved oxygen (DO) WQS defined in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.3](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I4ed90412cd1711dda432a117e6e0f345?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)) has no defined type for fresh surface water classes. If DO is used to assess a class C waterbody, the assessment will only support the Fishing use. While, if DO is used to assess a class A waterbody, the assessment will support Fishing, Secondary Contact Recreation, Primary Contact Recreation, and Source Water Supply uses. DO was specifically selected becuase it exemplifies a WQS with an indirect relationship to the uses supported; Secondary Contact Recreation, Primary Contact Recreation, and Source Water Supply uses are not directly influenced by DO levels. The majority of WQS and GV are indirectly linked to a specific designated best use by the waterbody classes and WQS/GV-type assigned to the standard.

Although most WQSs and GVs adhere to the logic represented in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general-uses), there are multiple discrepancies in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) and [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf).


### Discrepancies

The following WQS do not follow the logic depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general-uses). It is important to specifically document all discrepancies because these instances will require special attention while developing an automated process to perform assessments.

#### Class I

In [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf) Part 1A-Section 3. Water Classes and Type, WQSs for the saline surface water class I are associated with types Health (Consumption of Fish), Aquatic (Chronic), Aquatic (Acute), Wildlife Protection, and Aesthetic-- "Aesthetic" should most likely represent "Aesthetic (Food Source)" to align with the types defined in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.5](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Browse/Home/NewYork/NewYorkCodesRulesandRegulations?guid=I070d30d0b5a111dda0a4e17826ebc834&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default))). However, in Table 1 of [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf) and in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.5](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I4ed90418cd1711dda432a117e6e0f345?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1), class I water's are frequently and inconsistently excluded from the above mentioned types. This creates a class hierarchy that follows the logic in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-class-i) rather than the logic in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general).

```{r wqs-class-i, fig.align='center', out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="In some instances New York State saline surface water standards exclude class I from the hierarchy of class. The white-boxes represent the waterbody classes and the arrows indicate the direction that water quality standards are inherited through the class hierarchy. The red-box indicates that the waterbody class has been excluded from the hierarchy."}

This deviates from the general logic presented in (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general)B), which places class I in between classes SC and SB in the saline surface water hierarchy.
```



####  Aquatic (Acute)

Aquatic (Acute) designates a type of WQS. The class hierarchy associated with Aquatic (Acute) WQSs are treated inconsistently in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.5](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I4ed90418cd1711dda432a117e6e0f345?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1) and [TOGS 1.1.1](https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/water_pdf/togs111.pdf). In many instances, the class hierarchy follows the rules depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general), but there are multiple instances where Aquatic (Acute) WQSs and GVs are only applicable to fresh and saline surface water classes D and SD, respectively (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-aa)).

```{r wqs-aa, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px", fig.cap="Many water quality standards of type Aquatic (Acute) are only applicable for fresh and saline surface waters D and SD, respectively. Therefore, Aquatic (Acute) standards are not always inherited by the classes downstream of D and SD in their respective hierarchies. There is no standardized logic dictating when Aquatic (Acute) water quality standards are or are not inherited by their descendants."}

                        dpi = 300)
```

Table (X) is a modified version of the table in [Title 6 NYCRR, Part 703.5](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I4ed90418cd1711dda432a117e6e0f345?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&bhcp=1) subset to only include parameters associated with type Aquatic Acute; Aquatic Chronic types were also retained when they corresponded with an Aquatic Acute standard for a given parameter. In fresh surface waters the Aquatic Acute WQSs for un-ionized ammonia as NH~3~, benzidine, and carbofuran are only applicable to class D waters. While in saline surface waters arsenic, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and cyanide are only applicable to class SD waters. Endosulfan and total residual chlorine were only applicable to classes D and SD within fresh and saline surface waters, respectively. In all instances described, the Aquatic Acute standards are superseded by more stringent Aquatic Chronic standards for all classes downstream in the hierarchy-- except when class I's are missing (see [Class I]). There are also instances in Table (X) where the entire class hierarchy is specified for the Aquatic Acute type (e.g., fresh surface water arsenic and saline surface water Copper). This creates an odd discrepancy for assessments. For example, the arsenic fresh surface water Aquatic Acute and Aquatic Chronic standards are applicable to classes C, B, A, A-Special, AA, and AA-Special. Conversely, the arsenic saline surface water Aquatic Acute standard is only applicable to class SD waters, while the Aquatic Chronic standard is applicable to classes SC, SB, and SA. Thus, a class A waterbody would be assessed for both Aquatic Acute and Aquatic Chronic standards, while the saline counterpart class SA would only be assessed by the Aquatic Chronic standard.

#### Chlorobenzene

Chlorobenzene (108-90-7) 



#### Trout and Trout Spawning Waters

Fresh surface water classes C, B, A, A-Special, AA, and AA-Special have variants designating Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) waterbodies (e.g., C(T) and C(TS)). For the majority of parameters, these variants have the same WQS as the non-T/TS waterbody classes (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general)). Dissolved oxygen and ammonia as NH~3~ WQS differ between non-T/TS, T, and TS waterbody class variants (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-do-ammonia)); non-T/TS variants have the least stringent standards, while TS variants have the most stringent standards.

```{r wqs-do-ammonia, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.cap="New York State's fresh surface water dissolved oxygen and ammonia as NH~3~ water quality standards for class C, B, A, A-Special, AA, and AA-Special differ among Trout (T) and Trout Spawning (TS) class variants."}

                        dpi = 300)
```

#### Dissolved Solids

The WQS for dissolved solids in fresh surface waters is defined as "Shall be kept as low as practicable to maintain the best usage of waters but in no case shall it exceed 500 mg/L" for classes C, B, A, AA, and AA-Special (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-dissolved-solids)). The standard for class A-Special is "Shall not exceed 200 mg/L." This deviates from the general logic depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general) because the A-Special class is more stringent than its downstream classes, AA and AA-Special.

```{r wqs-dissolved-solids, fig.align='center', out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="New York State's fresh surface water dissolved solids water quality standards are more stringent for class A-Special than the other waterbody classes.

                        dpi = 300)
```

#### Total and Fecal Coliforms

The WQSs for total and fecal coliforms in fresh surface waters follow the logic dictated in Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-general), except there is no total coliform standard applicable to class AA-Special (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-total-coliforms)) and there are no fecal coliform standards applicable to class AA or AA-Special (Figure \@ref(fig:wqs-fecal-coliforms)).
